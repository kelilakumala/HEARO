# HEARO
A safety application designed to connect with a compact keychain alarm

This project focuses on creating a protoype of the HEARO safety device application. HEARO is a safety device that allows users to alert others when they are in danger by pressing the keychain that is connected to the app. In the app, users will be notified regarding the live location and information of the person in distress. The application includes several features:
1. Live location of the user which is tracked through the keychain alarm. Users can choose to share their location with emergency contacts
2. Automated call to emergency services once the device is activated
3. Alert when other users activate their device along with their information, last known location, and emergency contacts
4. Information on locations with highest levels of reports
5. Profile page to update emergency contacts, add HEARO device, and personal information

The marketing, publication, and revenue plan of this safety application was thought out along with the logo and device design. We created the business model canvas, competitive analysis, go-to market strategy, TAM-SAM-SOM, financial projections, and fundings for this project. 

_This project was created as part of BINUS University's Entrepreneurship course and is not published officially._
